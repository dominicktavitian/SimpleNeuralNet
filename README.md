# SimpleNeuralNet

This simple project takes in a simple data set of puppies and kittens sizes and labels them cat or dog. I constructed a simple Neural Network that given a new animals size, it will predict if it is a kitten or puppy that has been passed in. 

This was made with jupyter notebooks and saved down as a python script for easy readability. Very basic stuff, but a good intro to how neural networks work.
